                                                  -Variables-

number - used to hold the users value.    
dimes - used to initalize the amount of dimes the user needs.  
chanegeC - does nothing.  
changeD - is a holder for how many pennies is needed.  
changeE - is a holder for how many dimes is needed.  
halfdollar - used to initalize the amount of halfdollar the user needs.  
changeA - is a holder for how many halfdollars is needed.  
dollars - used to initalize the amount of dollars the user needs.   
changeB - is a holder for how many quaters is needed.   
nickles - used to initalize the amount of nickles the user needs.   
pennies - used to initalize the amount of pennies the user needs.   
quaters - used to initalize the amount of quaters the user needs.   
changeC - is a holder for how many dimes is needed.   
changeF - does nothing. 

                                                -Program is Sequential-
                                               
1.) The user will be prompted to enter the amount of dollars and ccents that need to be broke down.  
2.) A number will be hold the input in a scanner called in and held in the variable number.   
3.) Dollars will be parsed into an integer.    
4.) Dollars will be subtracted from numbers and placed in ChangeA's place holder.   
   -This will give a whole number to work with in the program.  
5.) changeA will be multiplied by .5 percent and placed in changeB.    
6.) changeA will then be divided by .5 and placed in changeA's holder.     
7.) changeA will then be parsed into an integer and placed in half.        

-This process will repeat until the program reaches pennies.-   

8.) Read statements will then display the amount of dollars, halfdollars, quaters,  
dimes, nickles, and pennies (rounded).     
9.) The program will then end.
